## INTRODUCTION ##

Speeches from presidents throughout 231 years since 1789 can serve as snapshot of US history. They are a good source to analyze the transition in presidents’ messages as new events in history unfold. This can be taken as how each presidents aligned or differed from each other when delivering messages about certain matters. This analysis explored this similarity and disparity by answering two questions:

### 1. How Republican and Democrat differed in opinion strength for the same topics

With two main parties, Republican and Democrat, one could expect polarity from presidents of these two parties about various subjects throughout the history. One aspect of strength of opinion is how positive/negative a person expresses his ideas. For example, “must take action immediately” has higher sentiment score than “should take action soon”.

### 2. How presidents show emotion in speeches addressing violence

For topics that involve suffering, painful experience, an effective way of communicating such matters is through showing empathy and commitment to take action in resolving the matters, or in other words, the compassion. The degree of showing empathy/compassion in speeches is also an indication of the characteristics of the discussed events and how the nature of these events changed. Measuring compassion is challenging as current researches in this subject are mostly in psychology literature. However, it is still possible to analyze emotion which is an important element of showing empathy or compassion. 

_Violence, Shooting, Terror_ are topics of interest to analyze the difference in emotion between presidents. _Violence, Shooting, Terror_ were analyzed together due to the similarity in their nature. Each topic individually can be considered as an escalated version of violent conflict. Violence included clash, attacks in general. Shooting included mass shootings and is a step up in violence both in seriousness and impact to community. Finally, Terror is the deadliest type of violence in this category. Such category gives convenience in observing the escalation in emotion terms.
